    - 'Enjoy the Hogs last win against the Crimson Tide. It''s not important that
      this was 15 years ago... Arkansas defeats #22 Alabama 24-23 in double OT with
      a pass to Ben Cleveland. Expectations were launched for Cleveland and the trio
      of Springdale Freshman, most of all quarterback Mitch Mustain'

    - 'Throw some salt on the wound with one of the toughest Arkansas losses in recent
      decades. Arkansas lead #1 and eventual national champion Alabama 20-7 deep in
      the third quarter. Two 4th quarter interceptions by Ryan Mallet let the Tide
      squeak out of Fayetteville with the victory. What might have been...'

    - Avoid if you have a weak stomach. Alabama crushes the Hogs 48-7 in 2019 as the
      Chad Morris Era spirals. Ouch.

    - 'Relive a dissapointing loss to LSU in 2006, as #5 Arkansas loses at home to
      #9 LSU with a trip to Atlanta on the line. 189 and two TD''s from Darren Mcfadden
      wasn''t enough to topple the Tigers.'

    - "#3 Arkansas and #1 LSU showdown in Baton Rouge in 2011. LSU Runs away with
      this one scoring 17 unanswered in the 4th quarter, on their way to national
      Championship game. A tough loss in an otherwise successful season for the Hogs,
      ending with a Cottonbowl victory"

    - "#12 Arkansas travels to Jordan-Hare for a piece of eventual National Champion
      Auburn and Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton. Arkansas gave Auburn a big scare,
      holding a fourth quarter lead thanks to brilliant quarterback play from Tyler
      Wilson who replaced injured Ryan Mallet. At a pivotal moment tailback Broderick
      Green fumbled and Auburn scooped and scored. With momentum entirely on Auburn's
      side Newton's tough running sealed the loss for Arkansas."

    - 'Let''s go back to 1986, when Arkansas took down #7 Texas A&M in Little Rock.
      It was a low scoring game (14-10 finish) with some late-game theatrics. A&M
      drove deep into Arkansas territory late in the fourth quarter with the chance
      to take the lead. The Razorback defense held tough and forced a turnover on
      downs after 3 consecutive incompletions to seal the victory.'

    - This one stung as Arkansas lost in a dogfight to Mississippi State in 2014.
      Arkansas had the ball in the red zone three times in the fourth quarter and
      did not come up with a single point.

    - 'Arkansas goes to Starkville in 2004 and comes out with the victory. Quarterback
      Matt Jones was hobbled by a hamstring injury that limited his rushing ability
      but was able to make up for that with 200+ passing yards. '
